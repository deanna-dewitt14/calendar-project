Welcome to your Work Day Calendar!

With the hussle and bussle of the day, keeping a schedule is important to keep on task.

When you go threw your work day you will find that your calendar will change colors depending on the time.

- Gray for past events
- Red for present events
- Green for future events

This will keep it easy to know what is currently going on during your work day, and keep track of your future events.

If you are going to enter in a new task please make sure you click on every save button at the end of the scheduled time or else it will not save!

Have a great day!
( Don't worry it will be 5 o'clock soon ðŸ˜‰ )
